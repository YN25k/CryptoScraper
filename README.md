I've always been found of and trading crypto after the 2020 halving. Yes I'm a little late on the scene but I still find it as an interesting hobby. 
However, while I mainly use simpleswap.io as my main source of swapping crypto I'm a little dissatisfied with the site not showing commission cause I KNOW they take that.
This is a little program I made myself that utilizes JSOUP library to scrape CoinGecko for real time prices. I wish to develop this further to become
a plugin for auto calculations of commission rates on simpleswap.io
